</div>

<div id="main"> 
  <h3>Welcome </h3> 
Real (2018$) annual household income (<a href="https://cps.ipums.org/cps-action/variables/HHINCOME" target="_blank">HHINCOME from IPUMS CPS ASEC</a>) in each state and DC from 1976 to 2018 is displayed on a 3D chart to show how income is distributed across the United States and within states. 
 
  <h3>Things you can do</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Apply individual state labels. </li>
  <li>Choose the year.</li>
  <li>Display four versions of real household income:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><strong>RHH</strong>: Real household income in 2018$</li>
  <li> <strong>ERHH</strong>: Real household income per (equivalized) person using square root equivalence scale, see <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/04/art2full.pdf" target="_blank">Johnson et al., 2005, p. 13</a></li>
  <li><strong>RHHRPP</strong>: Real household income adjusted for state prices using <a href="https://www.bea.gov/data/prices-inflation/regional-price-parities-state-and-metro-area" target="_blank">BEA's regional price parities</a>; 2008-2018 only</li>
  <li><strong>ERHHRPP</strong>: Real household income per (equivalized) person adjusted for state prices, 2008-2018 only</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>Download the data in the chart by clicking the down arrow in the top-right corner of the screen.</li>
  <li>Resize the chart by resizing your browser window. </li>
</ul>
<p>The rendering (by <a href="https://www.amcharts.com/" target="_blank">amCharts</a>) is interactive. <font style="color:#FF0000";>Hover your mouse</font> over different parts of the chart to get a popup with information.</p>
<p>Rendering may take a few seconds (depending on your device and connection). </p>

  <h3>Go to work</h3>
<p>Click the <strong>Start</strong> link below to start your visualizations.<a href="chart.html"target="_blank"></a> </p>
<p>Return to this page and click the <strong>Start</strong> link again to create a new tab where you can choose a different year. You can do this as many times as you wish. Now you can easily compare across years by moving among tabs. </p>
<p>The color scheme is always based on real household income (RHH) in 1976. This makes it easy to see how states changed rank over time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also look at a single state over time: </p>
<h1><a href="chartstatecolors.html" target="_blank"><strong>Individual state</strong></a></h1>

<h3>Animation</h3>
<p>We made these short videos to show the effect of sampling variability and demonstrate how household income has changed over time.</p>
